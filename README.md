# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## ðŸ§ª Objective
To capture, filter, and analyze network traffic using Wireshark.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts
- Packet capture
- DNS Query
- TCP Handshake
- Protocol Analysis
- Filtering techniques

## ðŸ›  Steps Performed
1. Opened Wireshark and started capturing on the Wi-Fi interface.
2. Accessed `www.google.com` and `example.com` to generate traffic.
3. Applied filters for DNS, TCP, and HTTP.
4. Captured screenshots of:
   - DNS Query Packet
   - TCP 3-Way Handshake
   - HTTP GET Request

**5. What is a DNS query packet?**  
A packet sent by a client to resolve domain names into IP addresses, usually over UDP port 53.

**6. How can packet capture help in troubleshooting?**  
It helps visualize network issues, like dropped connections, DNS failures, or misconfigurations.

**7. What is a protocol?**  
A protocol defines rules for communication between devices on a network (e.g., HTTP, TCP, DNS).

**8. Can Wireshark decrypt encrypted traffic?**  
Only under certain conditions (e.g., with decryption keys or passphrases); otherwise, encrypted traffic stays unreadable.
